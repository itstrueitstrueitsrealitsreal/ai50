# CS50AI Projects

This repository contains the projects required for Harvard's CS50AI course in 2024. Each project focuses on different aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Project 1: Search

In this project, you will implement various search algorithms, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search. You will apply these algorithms to solve problems like route planning and puzzle solving.

## Project 2: Knowledge

In this project, you will build a knowledge-based agent that can reason and make inferences using propositional logic. You will implement algorithms for forward chaining and backward chaining, and apply them to solve problems like the Wumpus World and Sudoku.

## Project 3: Uncertainty

In this project, you will explore probabilistic reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty. You will implement algorithms for probabilistic inference, such as the Bayesian network and the Markov decision process. You will apply these algorithms to solve problems like medical diagnosis and robot navigation.

## Project 4: Optimization

In this project, you will delve into optimization problems and algorithms. You will implement algorithms like hill climbing, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. You will apply these algorithms to solve problems like the traveling salesman problem and the knapsack problem.

## Project 5: Learning

In this project, you will dive into machine learning and implement algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning. You will build classifiers, regression models, and clustering algorithms. You will apply these algorithms to solve problems like image recognition and spam detection.

## Project 6: Neural Networks

In this project, you will explore the world of neural networks and deep learning. You will implement algorithms for feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. You will apply these algorithms to solve problems like image classification and natural language processing.
